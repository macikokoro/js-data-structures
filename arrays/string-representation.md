# String Representations of Arrays

In JavaScript there are two built in methods that return representations of an array **join( )** and **toString( )**. Both return a string containing the elements of an array delimited by commans.

```
var dynamicDuo = ["Batman", "Robin"];
var whoString = dynamicDou.join();
var whoString = dynamicDou.toString();
```
The result would be the same: Batman, Robin
